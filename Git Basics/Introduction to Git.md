# Introduction  

Git is like a really epic save button for your files and directories. Officially, Git is a **version control system**.  

A save in a text editor records all of the words in a document as a single file. You are only ever given one record of the file, such as `essay.doc`, unless you make duplicate copies (which is difficult to remember and manage):  

- `essay-draft1.doc`  
- `essay-draft2.doc`  
- `essay-final.doc`  

However, a save in **Git** records **differences** in the files and folders AND keeps a historical record of each save. This feature is a game changer.  

### Why is Git Useful?  
- As an **individual developer**, Git enables you to review how your project grows and to easily look at or restore file states from the past.  
- Once connected to a **network**, Git allows you to **push your project to GitHub** (or alternatives like Bitbucket, Beanstalk, or GitLab) for sharing and collaborating with other developers.  

> üí° Note: This curriculum **only supports GitHub**, and troubleshooting for alternatives is not provided.  

While **Git** works on your local machine, **GitHub** is a remote storage facility on the web for all your coding projects.  

### Why is GitHub Important?  
By learning Git, you can showcase your portfolio on **GitHub**!  
- Almost all **software development companies** require Git as an essential skill.  
- Having a **GitHub portfolio** provides proof of your skills to potential employers.  

### Lesson Structure  
In this lesson, we will:  
1. **Explore the history of Git**, what it is, and what it‚Äôs useful for.  
2. **Learn the basic workflow** for using Git and understand why it‚Äôs so useful.  
3. **Set up a Git project** that will serve as a template for your future projects.  

For now, let‚Äôs learn what Git is and why it‚Äôs so powerful!

## Assignment  

- üìñ **Read** Chapters 1.1 through 1.4 from the "Getting Started" section of **Pro Git** to learn the differences between **local, centralized, and distributed** version control systems.  
- üé• **Watch** ["What is Git?" explained in 2 minutes](#) ‚Äì a video about what Git is and how it improves workflow.  
- üìÑ **Read** ["About GitHub and Git"](#) for a brief introduction to how Git and GitHub work together. *(You can skip the "Where do I start?" section.)*  
- üñ•Ô∏è **Install Git** (if you haven‚Äôt yet) by following the **Setting Up Git** lesson.  
- üîç **Explore** [The Odin Project‚Äôs GitHub repository](#). Look at:  
  - How lessons are stored.  
  - All contributors and how Git records collaborative efforts.  
  - How GitHub visually represents contributions.
