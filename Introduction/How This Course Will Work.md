# Overview
- The Odin Project is an open-source community that teaches full-stack web development from scratch.
- The course provides structured learning, combining external resources with hands-on projects.
# What You Will Learn
- How the Web Works: Basics of how computers and the internet function.
- Development Environment: Setting up essential tools like Git and GitHub.
- Front-End Basics: Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Introduction to Back-End: A brief overview of server-side technologies.
- Practical Application: Building a basic webpage, adding styles, and implementing interactivity.
# Learning Approach
- The curriculum aggregates top-quality resources rather than creating new tutorials.
- Emphasis on problem-solving, research skills, and self-learning.
- Learning is not about memorization but applying knowledge through projects.
# Mindset Shift
- The goal is to develop thinking skills for programming rather than just learning tools.
- Understanding documentation is key; learning to read and interpret it is an essential skill.
# Importance of English in Programming
- The programming world is rooted in English (syntax, documentation, communities).
- Non-English speakers should take extra steps, such as using translation tools.
# Next Steps
After completing the introduction, learners can choose between:
- Full-Stack JavaScript path
- Full-Stack Rails path
Skipping sections is discouraged; each lesson builds on previous knowledge.
# Assignments & Knowledge Check
