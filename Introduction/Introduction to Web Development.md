# Types of Web Developers  

Earlier, we mentioned that web development work could be in the **front end, back end, or full stack**. What exactly do these terms mean?  

### **Front-End Development**  
The **front end** is the part you see in your browser, including the presentation of content and user interface elements like the navigation bar.  

**Front-end developers use:**  
- **HTML**  
- **CSS**  
- **JavaScript**  
- Relevant frameworks  

They ensure that content is presented effectively and that users have an excellent experience.  

### **Back-End Development**  
The **back end** refers to the inner workings of an application, which live on the **server**. It stores and serves program data to ensure that the front end has what it needs. This process can become very complicated when a website has millions of users.  

**Back-end developers use:**  
- **Java**  
- **Python**  
- **Ruby**  
- **JavaScript**  

### **Full-Stack Development**  
**Full-stack developers** are comfortable working with **both the front and back ends**.  

At **The Odin Project**, we focus on teaching **full-stack development**, covering all aspects of web development.
