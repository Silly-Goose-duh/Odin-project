# Introduction
The first step in building any website is having the right tools. For us, that means setting up a development environment for writing good code.

Many online development courses use in-browser code editors or "sandboxes," which provide just the necessary tools and programs for the task at hand. While sandboxes are great for getting started quickly, the best way to ensure long-term success is to work in a real development environment.

Setting up a development environment can be frustrating, but the experience is invaluable. Learning how to install packages, editors, and even entire operating systems will be a real-world skill you carry with you throughout your career.

# Lesson Overview
This section provides a general overview of what you will learn in this lesson:

- Supported operating systems (OS) for The Odin Project
- OS options and installation specifics (covered in the next lesson)

## Supported Operating Systems

### macOS
If you're using a Mac, you're in great shape! The Odin Project assumes a Unix-based system. With just a few installations, you'll be up and running in no time.

### Linux (Official Ubuntu Flavors)
Linux is a free and open-source OS that works well with all programming languages. Many development tools are built to run natively on Linux, offering:
- More frequent updates
- Easier troubleshooting
- Better performance

We recommend using **Ubuntu** or **Xubuntu** as they are user-friendly and widely supported.

### Windows
Windows is **not natively supported** by The Odin Project. Since many development tools are built for a Linux environment, you will need one even if you plan to use Windows. You have the following options:

1. **Virtual Machine (VM) using VirtualBox**  
   - Runs Linux inside Windows like a separate application.
   - Risk-free and easy to uninstall if needed.
   
2. **Dual-boot Ubuntu installation**  
   - Boots into either Linux or Windows.
   - Allows full access to system resources.
   - Requires modifying hard drive partitions but offers superior performance.
   
3. **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)**  
   - Runs Linux within Windows without a virtual machine.
   - Provides access to Linux tools with a simplified setup.

### Chromebook
If you use a Chromebook, you may be able to run a Linux terminal. More details will be provided in the next lesson.

# Concerned About Installing a New OS?

> *“Woah, woah, woah! I like my OS just fine the way it is!”*

If you are using Windows, don’t worry! Linux can coexist with Windows on your hard drive. You don’t have to lose your files or favorite settings. However, many development tools are designed for Unix-based systems, and using workarounds can be frustrating.

Modifying or dual-booting your system will:
- Create a distraction-free coding environment.
- Make programming easier by avoiding compatibility issues.
- Improve your resume by familiarizing you with industry-standard tools.

Still unsure? Here’s why installing Linux is beneficial:
- **Tested and Verified** – Our instructions work best with macOS, Ubuntu, and WSL2.
- **Community Support** – The Odin Project's Discord community can better assist Linux and macOS users.
- **Development Tools Compatibility** – Many web development technologies (e.g., Ruby on Rails, Node.js) are designed to run on Unix-based platforms.
- **Performance** – Linux is lightweight and runs efficiently on older machines.

Many learners ask if following these installation guidelines is necessary. The Odin Project Discord moderators wrote this guide and stand by these recommendations. 

### Important Note
We **do not support native Windows** as a development environment. This has been discussed many times, and it is not a viable option at this time. Please avoid asking about Windows support in our Discord community.
