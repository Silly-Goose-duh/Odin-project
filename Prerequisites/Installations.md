# Introduction
If you are already using **MacOS, Ubuntu, or an official flavor of Ubuntu** as your operating system and have **Google Chrome** as an installed browser, you can skip this lesson. Otherwise, click on the small arrow to the left of the method you would like to use below to expand that section, and then follow the installation instructions.

## Be mindful of the OS you are using
We can only support the operating systems indicated above. Our instructions have been tested with **MacOS, Ubuntu, and official flavors of Ubuntu**. We do not recommend installing an OS that is only based on Ubuntu (like **Mint, Pop!_OS, ElementaryOS**, etc.).

## Lesson Overview
This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson:
- How to set up a proper environment to follow **The Odin Project** curriculum.
- Installing **Google Chrome** in your environment.

## Assignment
1. If you’re not already running a supported environment, decide on which environment you’re going to set up.
2. Look through the instructions so you know what to expect.
3. Choose and follow one of the instructions below.
4. After you have your environment sorted, proceed to the **Google Chrome installation instructions**.

## OS Installation
### **IMPORTANT**
This curriculum only supports using a **laptop, desktop, or supported Chromebook**. We cannot help you set up a developer environment on a **Raspberry Pi** or any other device. You only need to follow **one** of these sets of instructions or **none** if you are already using **MacOS, Ubuntu, or an official flavor of Ubuntu** as your operating system.

### Pick your method of installation below:
- **Virtual Machine (Recommended)**
- **Ubuntu/Windows Dual-Boot**
- **ChromeOS/ChromeOS Flex**
- **WSL2 (Advanced)**

## Google Chrome Installation
### **Why Google Chrome?**
Because our lessons use **Google Chrome**, and Chrome/Chromium are overwhelmingly used by developers and consumers, the recommendations we make are very intentional. Look at [this usage share of web browsers](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share) and see what other folks are using the most.
