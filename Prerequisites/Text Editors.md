# Introduction  
A text editor is by far the most used developer tool regardless of what type of developer you are. A good text editor can help you write better code with real-time code checking, syntax highlighting, and automatic formatting.  

## Why canâ€™t I use Microsoft Word?  
Rich text editors, such as Microsoft Word and LibreOffice Writer, are great for writing a paper, but the features that make them good at creating nicely formatted documents make them unsuitable for writing code. A document created with these rich text editors has more than just text embedded in the file. These files also contain information on how to display the text on the screen and data on how to display graphics embedded into the document. In contrast, plain text editors, such as VSCode and Sublime, donâ€™t save any additional information. Saving only the text allows other programs, like Rubyâ€™s interpreter, to read and execute the file as code.  

## Code Editors  
You can think of code editors as specialized web development tools. They are highly customizable and offer many features that will make your life easier. There is nothing worse than spending two hours trying to figure out why your program isnâ€™t working, only to realize that you missed a closing bracket.  

Features of code editors include:  
- Plugins  
- Syntax highlighting  
- Auto-closing of brackets and braces  
- Linting  

There are many text editors out there to choose from, but we suggest starting with **Visual Studio Code**.  

### Why Visual Studio Code?  
Visual Studio Code, or just **VSCode**, is an excellent free code editor. It has outstanding add-on support and great Git integration. VSCode is the most popular code editor among Odinâ€™s students and moderators, so support is easy to find in the community.  

While you are free to use any editor, this course assumes you are using **VSCode** because:  
- Itâ€™s free  
- Itâ€™s easy to use  
- It works consistently across different operating systems  

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** If youâ€™re using a **virtual machine**, install VSCode on your **VM**. You can also install it on your host system (e.g., Windows), but ensure your VM has it as well.  

## VSCode Installation  
Choose your operating system:  
- [Linux](#)  
- [MacOS](#)  
- [WSL2](#)  

## Assignment  
Familiarizing yourself with VSCode will allow you to save time and become more productive. By watching this [VSCode Tutorial for Beginners](#) video, youâ€™ll get an idea of all the features VSCode has to offer.  

ðŸ‘‰ **You donâ€™t need to code alongâ€”just observe how VSCode is used.**
